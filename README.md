# POW - Performance Optimizations for Windows

# Tool for increasing System Performance across multiple Features for a broad set of use cases.
# 
# Contents are:
#
# A custom swapfile-size for optimal Experiences in Gaming and Emulation in the 'Performance Options'
# Deactivation of Mouse Smoothening and Enhanced pointer precision in the Mouse settings
# and many more to come!

# Performance Options: Under the Advanced Tab, select "Programs" in the 'Adjust for best performance of'-category
# Below that, Click on "Change", and select (if possible) a secondary SSD and set the initial size to 16384MB (16GB) and the maximum size to 32768MB (32GB).
# This ensures that performance-dropoffs arent as noticeable if your System Memory runs full.
# Especially useful when using Emulators, as those compile Shaders and load them into the System Memory for less stuttering in the game.
