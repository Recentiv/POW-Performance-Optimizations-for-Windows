### Performance Options
Performance Options: Under the Advanced Tab, select "Programs" in the 'Adjust for best performance of'-category
Below that, Click on "Change", and select (if possible) a secondary SSD and set the initial size to 16384MB (16GB) and the maximum size to 32768MB (32GB).
This ensures that performance-dropoffs arent as noticeable if your System Memory runs full.
Especially useful when using Emulators, as those compile Shaders and load them into the System Memory for less stuttering in the game.
